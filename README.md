# üöó Predictive Analytics: Linear Regression on Vehicle Fuel Efficiency

## üìå Abstract
This project investigates the factors influencing vehicle fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), using a dataset containing various automotive attributes. The analysis involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of regression models including **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, and **Lasso Regression**. The study identifies key predictors of MPG and demonstrates the effectiveness of regularization techniques in improving model performance and interpretability.

## üìñ Introduction
Fuel efficiency is a crucial metric in the automotive industry due to increasing environmental concerns, rising fuel prices, and tightening government regulations. The primary goals of this project are:

- To identify the automotive features that most significantly impact fuel efficiency.
- To build regression models that predict MPG using these features.
- To extract actionable insights from the data that could inform vehicle design and policy decisions.

## üß™ Methods

### Data Cleaning
- Inspected the dataset for missing, non-numeric, and irregular values.
- Imputed missing numerical values using the **median**, a robust measure against outliers.
- Removed outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method to prevent skewed model performance.
- Normalized continuous variables using **MinMaxScaler** to ensure uniform feature scaling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
- Analyzed pairwise feature relationships and distribution trends.
- Calculated **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to detect and address multicollinearity.

### Feature Selection
- Used **p-values** from statistical modeling to identify significant predictors.
- Applied **Lasso Regression** to automatically select the most relevant features by shrinking less important ones to zero.

## ü§ñ Model Building & Evaluation

Three regression models were developed:

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - R¬≤: 0.78  
   - Significant predictors: model year, acceleration, vehicle origin.

2. **Ridge Regression**  
   - R¬≤: 0.79  
   - Improved generalization and reduced overfitting via L2 regularization.

3. **Lasso Regression**  
   - R¬≤: 0.78  
   - Simplified model by selecting only impactful features using L1 regularization.

Models were evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (R¬≤)**

## üí¨ Discussion

### Key Findings:
- **Model Year**: Strong positive impact on MPG; newer vehicles tend to be more efficient.
- **Acceleration**: Positively associated with MPG, suggesting better-tuned engines.
- **Vehicle Origin**: US-made vehicles showed slightly lower MPG compared to foreign-made cars.

### Model Insights:
- **Regularization** techniques improved robustness and interpretability.
- **Lasso Regression** effectively simplified the model by removing redundant features.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The analysis successfully identified critical predictors of vehicle fuel efficiency using regression-based machine learning models. This project demonstrates the power of combining statistical techniques with machine learning to derive practical insights from real-world data.

### Future Work:
- Explore non-linear models such as **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** to capture complex patterns.
- Expand the analysis using more diverse or up-to-date datasets to improve generalizability.
